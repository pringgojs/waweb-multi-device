# Staterkit Whatsapp web API

This project serves as a starter kit for a Whatsapp web forwarder. In explanation, the project forwards messages from Whatsapp web to the backend, allowing further processing according to specific needs. As we are aware, to leverage the Whatsapp API, one typically needs to subscribe with META as the owner of Whatsapp or collaborate with third-party entities such as Twilio and others. The project utilizes the library from https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js. Thank you
